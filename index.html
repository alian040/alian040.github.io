        <p class="lead mb-4">Growing up with a childcare business in my own home has had a profound impact on me in several ways. Mainly, it has instilled in me a strong sense of responsibility that is deeply intertwined with my empathy for others. I grew up as a child with a deep sense of empathy for the people around me and frequently did all I could to support them emotionally. During the pandemic, I had the responsibility of being reliable and proactive in ensuring that quality care was still being provided to the children still under our care. I willingly embraced these responsibilities because I knew that not doing so could very well lead to consequences for my motherâ€™s mental well-being. The combination of these two characteristics has made me an individual with a heightened sense of awareness of peopleâ€™s needs and an understanding of the importance of taking actions to support them. It is for these reasons that when I undertake a task, I am not content with merely doing the bare minimum when I know there is more within my capacity to accomplish. I feel fulfillment knowing that by giving my best effort, I am not only meeting my own standards but also fulfilling my responsibility to serve others to the best of my ability.<br><br>

        Aside from my daycare experience, I also volunteered at the Riverside Community Hospital as a Cope Health Scholar. I was determined to push myself to persistently interact with nurses and other healthcare professionals to establish a sense of familiarity and trust with them. By building rapport with those around me, I was included in patient care opportunities and witnessed interesting occurrences on the floor I was working on. I was content to do only the minimum for the purposes of stating how many hours I completed and put into this program more much time and effort as I saw this experience as a profound learning experience rather than a chore that I simply checked off a checklist.<br><br>

        One of my most valuable skillsets, is also being able to communicate complex science concepts to peers and non-technical audiences alike. I had always struggled in academia from as young as elementary all the way into high school. I have a keen understanding about how to build up knowledge depending on my audience's background.
